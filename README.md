## e621-py Wrapper & Fork Justification

This project uses [`e621-py`](https://github.com/eoan-ermine/e621-py), a Python wrapper for the [e621 API](https://e621.net/help/api).  
However, the original package does not fully serialize `Post` models due to recent changes in the API schema and missing fields, causing runtime errors and broken JSON conversion.

To resolve this, the following improvements were made and are included in a fork:

📌 **Forked Repository:**  
**https://github.com/austinjb995/e621-py**

🔧 **Modifications Include:**
- Added fallback handling for missing `alternates` and `sample` fields in `Post` models.
- Custom serialization support for `set` objects to enable proper `json.dump()`.
- Updated client instantiation to accept `(username, api_key)` auth tuple securely.
- Tested compatibility with Pydantic v1.10.

This fork is referenced in the `requirements.txt` as:
